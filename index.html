			<p class="pull-left">“When I started at Cat 5 CrossFit I weighed 140lbs and was very skinny.   I was very weak and had never worked out.  After 3 ½ months, I have gained 13 pounds of muscle and I am much stronger then I have ever been. Cat 5 has changed my life. The coaches are top notch and want nothing more than to see everyone at the box succeed. They have taught to me to push past mental walls with our workouts.  This has also helped with other mental obstacles in life as well. To sum it up Cat 5 crossfit has changed my life, it has made me <span class="red">healthier, stronger and an all-around better person.</span></p>

			<p class="pull-left">Special thanks to Josh Werner, Robby Grove, and the whole Cat 5 team for their support.”</p>

			<p class="pull-left">“I was born and raised in <span class="red">Jupiter, FL</span>. I played sports my whole life, and had opportunities to play baseball at the collegiate level, but threw it all away for drugs and alcohol. From 15 to 18, it was drugs alcohol jails cops and homelessness living on the streets. At age 18 I got sober. <span class="red">When I found Cat 5</span>, it was one of the best things I could have done.  I've never been this strong. I’m made to challenge my self everyday. I consider Cat 5 to be a second home and a family.  Cat 5 CrossFit is a huge piece of why I am and why I stay sober. </p>
